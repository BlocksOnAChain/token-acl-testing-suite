# Current Test Coverage Analysis

## Current Tests (5 Tests, 26 Assertions)

### ✅ What We're Testing Now

1. **PDA Derivation Correctness** (5 assertions)
   - Bump seed validity
   - PDA is off-curve
   - Deterministic derivation
   - Different mints → different PDAs
   - Different programs → different PDAs

2. **Discriminator Validation** (5 assertions)
   - Thaw discriminator matches sRFC 37 spec
   - Freeze discriminator matches sRFC 37 spec
   - Discriminators are different
   - Discriminators are exactly 8 bytes
   - Discriminators are not all zeros

3. **MintConfig Structure** (7 assertions)
   - Discriminator field correct
   - Mint field matches
   - Authority field matches
   - Gating program field matches
   - Serialization works
   - Deserialization works
   - Round-trip serialization matches

4. **Permission Flags Independence** (4 assertions)
   - All flag combinations work (4 cases)
   - Flags are independent
   - Toggling one doesn't affect the other

5. **Gating Program Validation Logic** (5 assertions)
   - Approved program validates
   - Unapproved program rejected
   - Default pubkey means no gating
   - Must have gating program for permissionless ops
   - Validation logic works correctly

## ❌ Critical Logic NOT YET Tested

Based on your requirements, we're missing tests for:

### 1. FAMP Canonical Implementation
**From sRFC**: "The FAMP will have a canonical implementation"

**Missing Tests**:
- ❌ FAMP maintains regular freeze authority
- ❌ FAMP allows issuer to override gating program decisions
- ❌ FAMP preserves all baseline freeze/thaw capabilities

### 2. Interface Optional Method Support
**From sRFC**: "Implementation decides whether a given method is supported or not, and how to behave if not supported - always accept or fail"

**Missing Tests**:
- ❌ Allow list can implement only `can_thaw_permissionless` (freeze returns error)
- ❌ Block list can implement only `can_freeze_permissionless` (thaw returns error)
- ❌ Hybrid can implement both
- ❌ Unsupported method returns proper error

### 3. Issuer Control Retention
**From sRFC**: "FAMP will still allow a regular defined Freeze Authority that is kept under control of the issuer"

**Missing Tests**:
- ❌ Issuer can call permissioned freeze (bypasses gating)
- ❌ Issuer can call permissioned thaw (bypasses gating)
- ❌ Issuer authority works even with 3rd party gating program

### 4. Gating Program Limited Power
**From sRFC**: "User defined Smart Contract that gates the permissionless functions only has the ability to fail those transactions"

**Missing Tests**:
- ❌ Gating program can ONLY fail transactions (cannot force approve)
- ❌ Gating program receives read-only permissions
- ❌ Gating program cannot modify state
- ❌ Gating program cannot bypass issuer authority

### 5. 3rd Party Gating with Issuer Control
**From sRFC**: "Issuers can use a 3rd party created allow or block list and still remain in full control"

**Missing Tests**:
- ❌ Issuer can change gating program
- ❌ Issuer can disable permissionless operations
- ❌ Issuer can forfeit freeze authority back
- ❌ 3rd party gating cannot take control from issuer

---

## Recommendation: Add Missing Tests

We need to add **~10-15 more real tests** to cover:
1. FAMP baseline features (regular freeze/thaw)
2. Interface optional method support
3. Issuer authority preservation
4. Gating program limitation validation
5. 3rd party independence with issuer control

Should I create these additional real tests now?
