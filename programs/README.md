# Production Gate Programs

This directory contains production-ready implementations of gating programs for the sRFC 37 Token ACL standard.

## Available Programs

### Production Allow List (`production_allow_list/`)
A full-featured, production-ready allow list implementation that includes:

**Core Features:**
- Complete sRFC 37 interface implementation
- Admin controls for managing allow list
- Tiered access levels (Basic, Enhanced, Institutional)
- Expiry handling for time-based access
- Authority management and rotation
- Comprehensive error handling

**Advanced Features:**
- Batch operations for efficiency
- Event logging for audit trails
- Upgrade authority management
- Multi-signature support
- Rate limiting and abuse prevention

**Security Features:**
- Input validation and sanitization
- Access control enforcement
- Reentrancy protection
- Overflow/underflow protection
- Proper error handling

## Production Deployment

### Prerequisites
- Security audit completed
- Test coverage verified
- Performance benchmarks met
- Documentation reviewed

### Deployment Steps
1. **Audit the code** - Security review required
2. **Test thoroughly** - Use the integration test suite
3. **Deploy to devnet** - Test with real network conditions
4. **Deploy to mainnet** - Production deployment
5. **Monitor and maintain** - Ongoing operations

### Configuration
The production allow list supports extensive configuration:
- Access level definitions
- Expiry policies
- Authority hierarchies
- Rate limiting rules
- Audit logging levels

## Security Considerations

**Critical Security Requirements:**
- ✅ Permission de-escalation enforced
- ✅ Input validation implemented
- ✅ Access control verified
- ✅ Error handling comprehensive
- ✅ Audit logging enabled

**Production Checklist:**
- [ ] Security audit completed
- [ ] Penetration testing performed
- [ ] Code review completed
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Monitoring configured
- [ ] Incident response plan ready

## Performance

**Benchmarks:**
- Thaw operation: ~8,000 CU
- Freeze operation: ~8,000 CU
- Batch operations: Optimized for efficiency
- Account limits: Well within Solana limits

**Optimization:**
- Efficient data structures
- Minimal account reads
- Optimized PDA derivation
- Batch processing support

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Key Metrics
- Operation success rates
